# Content

Documentation contents should be tailored to the needs of each particular project. However, generally, most documentation of significant projects should, at a minimum, include the information outlined below in some way.

## Background

The background of a project should more or less answer the following questions:

- What is the project about?
- What does it do?
- Why did you make it?
- What does it solve?
- What use cases does it have?

It may also talk about the following:

- The Features of the project
- The project structure
- The history of the project
- Other information that may be useful in introducing the project

## Usage

The usage section should at least state the following:

- Prerequisites or requirements to use the project
- How to install and get started using the project
- General instructions on how to use the project

It may also include the following:

- Caveats
- Reference guides
- Tutorials
- Different examples of how the project can be used
- In-depth documentation

## Developing

This section should introduce those new to the project to project-specific details on how to get started developing it. It could include, among others, how to compile the source code, how to run the development server, and how to run tests.

## Contributing

The contributing section should supplement the previous so that when someone is ready to commit their changes after some development, this section can inform them what requirements are necessary for their code to be merged. How to run linters or formatters and the style guide/s the project follows are examples of this.

## Versioning and changelogs

This section can be skipped if the project is not versioned.

If versioning is used, then strictly follow the [Semantic Versioning 2.0 Specification](https://semver.org) and loosely follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0) guidelines.

## Licenses, attributions, and 3rd party assets

This section should include the following when appropriate:

- Statement of the project license and copyright
- Attributions to people, organizations, and/or contributors
- Acknowledgments of 3rd party assets used such as APIs, libraries, fonts, icons, etc.
