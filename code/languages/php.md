# PHP

## Strings

- Use single (') quotes for single-line regular strings. If single quotes are used within the string, then double (") quotes should be used.
- Use double quotes for single-line interpolated strings.
- Use nowdoc syntax for multi-line regular strings.
- Use heredoc syntax for multi-line interpolated strings.
