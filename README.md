# Standards

This repository contains documents that describe the practices, tools, and licenses that I like to use when creating my personal coding projects. It's mainly to remind myself of what to set up and what guidelines I follow when creating a new one.

The [`code`](code) directory holds the files that articulate the coding style and tools that my projects should use.

The [`documentation`](documentation) directory contains the documents that state what the [content](documentation/content.md) and [writing style](documentation/writing-style.md) of my projects' documentation should be.

The [`licenses`](licenses) directory holds my [license guide](licenses/license-guide.md) and the plain text versions of the licenses that I use.
